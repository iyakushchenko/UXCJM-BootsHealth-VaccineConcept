### Invented hover / loading chrome not in Make = ship fail (PO rage #3)

- **Symptom:** React PLP showed **duplicate** “Updating results…” (count line + spinner label) + listing **jump**; empty bookmark heart went **fuchsia on hover** (Make tertiary empty hover is navy link; fuchsia only when filled/active).
- **Root cause:** Agents “improved” Make — invented fuchsia-on-empty hover and doubled loader copy / pulsed count — then stamped **PROVEN** without MCP real-user matrix.
- **Forbidden:** Invent hover colors, loader copy placement, or attention chrome not present in Make CSS/behavior. Prefer under-matching over inventing.
- **Gate:**
  1. Uma side-by-side Make vs React for **empty vs filled** icon states and **exactly one** loader treatment (spinner ± one label; never duplicate count-line copy).
  2. Quinn + Ben: **MCP localhost real-user matrix mandatory for every screen ship** — overlay start → log each step → stop/clean slate. Arch **rejects** audit **PROVEN** without that evidence log.
  3. Prior “PROVEN” is **BAD until re-proven** when PO disputes pixels.

### Wrong preloader / loading scenario = fidelity fail (PO called out twice)

- **Symptom:** React PLP filter-change showed a blank listing band with only “Updating results…” (results-count text) — PO rage again; not the Make scenario.
- **Make truth (PLP child 9):** ~450ms load → **hide tiles** → **centered spinner overlay** (44px arc + **one** “Updating results…” under spinner) on height-locked host → stagger reveal. **Not** opacity-0 tiles, **not** text-only, **not** duplicate count-line “Updating results…”.
- **Root cause:** Loading/empty/updating treated as copy polish, not a first-class Make scenario; register marked “preloader Fixed” without mechanism prove; Uma did not sign off loading states.
- **Gate:**
  1. Uma + Bea capture Make loading mechanism **before** Finn codes ([UMA_FIDELITY_NOTES.md](./UMA_FIDELITY_NOTES.md) §0).
  2. Bea register P0 rows for loading/empty/updating with layout notes + screenshot notes.
  3. Quinn proves filter-change: spinner/overlay **in-band**, then results return — blank+text alone = FAIL; duplicate “Updating results…” = FAIL.
  4. **team check:** Uma must explicitly report `loading states — PASS|FAIL` and `checkbox/radio hover — PASS|FAIL`.

### Checkbox / radio hover miss on migrated PLP

- **Symptom:** React filter checkboxes had no Make mint hover (`#c6e5e1`); Make `globals-chrome` targets `[data-name="box"]` which React rows do not use.
- **Gate:** Page CSS must port unchecked hover wash; Uma + Quinn prove hover visible on every migrated checkbox/radio.

### Make → React fidelity (PO rage — not first time)

- **Symptom:** PLP shipped “PROVEN” while Advantage Card promo bar was entirely missing, tile had invent border, Book now hover was mint secondary (LEGACY catch-all), heart had weak/laggy feedback, Reset Filters was text-only — register Wrongly marked OK / residual.
- **Root cause:** Make→React ships without a pixel+interaction register prove; Uma skipped Nazi-hover on every CTA/icon; Bea register incomplete (bands not inventoried before Finn coded); Quinn passed with unchecked P0s / “prior ship” wishlist.
- **PO context:** Human PO has complained before about near-dups / fidelity slips — **zero tolerance**. Missing whole components = ship fail.
- **Gate:**
  1. Bea register lists **every** Make band/component before Finn codes ([UMA_FIDELITY_NOTES.md](./UMA_FIDELITY_NOTES.md)).
  2. Uma Nazi-hovers every CTA/icon; runs full fidelity checklist; audit PROVEN only when checklist PASS.
  3. Quinn cannot PASS if register has unchecked P0s; must click-hover every interactive control (interaction matrix).
  4. **team check** must include Uma checklist + Bea register completeness + Quinn interaction matrix — ship not done if Uma or Quinn FAIL.
- **Example miss:** PLP Advantage Card bar — “Collect 3 points for every £1 you spend with Boots Advantage Card‡”.

### Versioning / felonies

- **Version chip wins overflow** — sticky right block with solid PANEL fill + z-index; never let scrolling tabs cover `vX.Y.Z` / channel.
- **Version chip must track package.json live** — Vite `define` alone freezes semver at `npm run dev` start; after bumps the tab chip lied (0.0.1 while package was 0.0.3). Source of truth = JSON import of `package.json` in `studioRelease.ts` + server restart on package.json change; unit test + `check:felonies` must fail on hardcoded UI semver / missing import. Quinn proves chip after every bump ([VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md) DoD).
- **Felony = `npm test` fail** — wire `check:felonies` + `check:version`; do not rely on docs alone. JSDoc must not contain `*/` mid-word (e.g. write "proto star filenames", not `proto*/…`).
- **Channel ≠ semver** — PO accepts alpha/beta/rc/stable; BE bumps digits via `release.mjs` / notes habit.

### Recording

- **Demo-click replay needs stable targets** — prefer `data-studio-action` on the click element; stop the selector chain there. Ancestor `data-name` noise (progress "Step N", breadcrumbs) breaks nested resolve.
- **Replay ≠ screen advance** — re-firing Continue proves interaction parity even when product logic opens a picker (no location yet). Do not require step navigation for a demo-click PROVE.
- **Wire-intent beat actions ≠ retreat-sync** — known `JourneyBeatActionId` → `runBeatAction`; `retreat-sync` → same script channel as director with `syncState` (`applyRecordingProjectScript` + `retreatScriptOptions`), not `runBeatAction`.
- **Human REC clicks = trusted only** — document capture-phase `click` with `isTrusted`; skip `.studio-nav-panel-host` / agent overlay; demo `.click()` stays on `notePlaybackDemoClick` (no double-capture).
- **Overlay root class must match CSS** — agent testing root is `.studio-agent-testing-overlay` (not bare `.agent-testing-overlay`); mismatch breaks PANEL CSS and lets Dismiss leak into REC capture.
- **Director replay needs scriptKind or resolvable id** — capture `scriptKind` on the interaction record; fall back to `resolvePlaybackScriptKind(scriptId)` for older sessions.

### Domain identity

- **No new `.proto-*` / `data-proto-*`.** PANEL/chrome classes are `.studio-nav-*` / `.studio-*`; DOM attrs are `data-studio-*` (`dataset.studio*`). Prefer `__studio*` window APIs; keep `__proto*` aliases. Concept Make leftovers may stay `.proto-*` in LEGACY until that screen retires — do not invent new ones. Gate: [NAMING.md](./NAMING.md) + Nazi QA light after chrome class renames.
- **Half-renames kill agents** — className + CSS + smoke/MCP selectors must move together (one codemod). Dual attrs only if a release truly needs them; prefer clean cut.
- **Storage/events** — `studio-nav:` / `studio-hub:` / `studio-*-sync` with one-time legacy read; beat field `protoTab` waits for a schema migration.

### File hygiene

- **Monster files block agents** — default 1600 LOC via `npm run check:hygiene`. Allowlist LEGACY Make dumps + current engine ceilings; prefer domain cohesion splits over micro-file zoos or silent ceiling bumps ([HYGIENE.md](./HYGIENE.md)).

### Studio chrome

- **REC ⊗ CJM is XOR, not only AIR.** CJM on → REC `disabled`; REC on → CJM off. AIR still locks both. Gate: `src/app/nav/studioModeXor.ts` + MCP sanity `rec-disabled-when-cjm-on` / `rec-enabled-when-cjm-off-idle`. Audit row **G6**.
- **Blast-radius adjacent chrome** — after any UI edit, scan sibling links/CTAs, counters, mode labels, panel XOR, AIR/browse locks. Do not only test the pixel you touched.

### DS / links / CSS

- **Near-dup text links forbidden** — one footer-like pattern (`.uxds-link` + LEGACY aliases): no underline at rest, underline on hover. Enforce with `npm run check:links` ([DS_STRICTNESS.md](./DS_STRICTNESS.md)).
- **Make `!important` vs kit tokens** — when retiring Make for a React screen, do not fight LEGACY `!important` forever; hide Make chrome and style the React host in page CSS / UXDS / theme. No LEGACY growth for new React pages.
- **Incomplete CSS grid / flex rows must left-align** — never `justify-content: space-between` with narrower pad spacers on short last rows (Book Step 2 time slots). Prefer CSS `grid` with fixed columns, or equal-width pads + `flex-start`.

### Hybrid Make + React

- **Distrust “done” without browser proof** — green Vitest/build/smoke alone are BAD for UI. Live localhost or CSS gate; write audit **PROVEN** under `docs/projects/<project-id>/audits/` (Boots: `docs/projects/boots-pharmacy/audits/`).
- **Hybrid mount gates** — when React mounts, hide Make duplicates (`data-studio-make-retired`); gate Make wire handlers with `isBookStepNReactMounted()`; preserve `data-name` / AIR hooks (`data-studio-open-appointment`, `data-studio-cal-*`).
- **querySelector first-match traps** — Make DOM often still exists (hidden). Prefer React host selectors or React-owned props for clicks (e.g. progress Step 1 → `onBackToStep1`), not wiring the first Make progress node.
- **createRoot `unmount()` must not run sync during parent React render/commit** — calling `root.unmount()` from `useLayoutEffect` / effect cleanup while `BootsPharmacyProjectView` is committing triggers: *Attempted to synchronously unmount a root while React was already rendering*. Defer with `setTimeout(0)` (or equivalent); cancel the deferred unmount on remount so Step tab / AIR / CJM flips do not race. Gate: `mountBookStep{1,2,3}Screen.tsx`.

### Navigation / journeys

- **Progress / Studio “Step 1” ≠ Make “tab1”.** Book Step 1 is `INDEX_BOOK_STEP1` (screen index **4**, child **7**, protoTab **5**). Agentic CJM has no beat on that tab; beat-index fallback to `agentic-home` must **not** `goToTab` while browsing (`shouldNavigateBeatTabOnEnter` / `scenarioBrowseMode`).
- **Named screen indices** — use `INDEX_BOOK_STEP*` / `INDEX_PLP` from `screens.ts`; avoid magic `setCurrent(4)` comments that confuse childIndex vs screen index.

### Docs layout

- **Project docs live under `docs/projects/<id>/`** — design deltas, screen pilots, FE audits, migrate-ready reports. Engine doctrine / FE standards / templates stay in `docs/product/`. Old heavily linked paths keep thin stubs. Do not dump Boots files into `docs/product/`.

### Naming

- **Screen folder = `screenId`** — use `screens/book-step-1/` for `?screen=book-step-1`, never `book-step1`. Journey **beat** ids may stay compact (`book-step2`) until a dedicated migration; URL aliases normalize them ([../shell/URL.md](../shell/URL.md)). New files follow [NAMING.md](./NAMING.md).
- **No `proto*` filenames / new classes / new attrs** — see Domain identity above.

### CI / Pages / MCP

- **CI smoke is on-demand** — default CI = unit + build; Playwright smoke = `workflow_dispatch` / local `npm run smoke` only ([CI_ACTIONS_BUDGET.md](./CI_ACTIONS_BUDGET.md)).
- **Post-push sitrep mandatory (BE / Director)** — after push, run `gh run list -R iyakushchenko/ux-studio -L 10`; do **not** tell the PO CI is green from local tests alone. `cancelled` Deploy/CI often means a newer push superseded the run — check the tip SHA. → [CI_ACTIONS_BUDGET.md](./CI_ACTIONS_BUDGET.md) §5.
- **Pages verify after chrome ships** — deploy green ≠ visual proof; check deployed host for `data-studio-react-screen` + MCP sanity on the live URL when chrome/pages matter.
- **Agent MCP testing overlay** — BR corner status + invisible click capture (no lightbox). `stop()` enters ~5s DONE/SITREP (readable log, click guard released) then clears; MCP helpers use `stop({ reload: true })` so reload runs **after** sitrep; Dismiss/`forceClear` is instant; never restore stale persist on load ([../shell/RECORDING.md](../shell/RECORDING.md)).
- **Overlay stuck after agent work** — `helperOverlayArm` `touch()` on mutating helpers (e.g. EnsureCleanStudio) without a matching `stop()` left the panel active with only “overlay start”; titles concatenated `__studioEnsureCleanStudio` and CSS `uppercase` read as garbled `STUDIOENSURE…`. Fix: clean titles only; do not arm on EnsureCleanStudio/AbortAll; idle auto-stop ~45s → sitrep; `forceClear()`; Run helpers keep `finally` → `stop({ reload: true })`.
- **Post-agent clean slate** — `&modal=choose-pharmacy` survives sitrep reload unless stripped; always `resetStudioAfterAgentTest()` → hub + no modal **before** `location.reload()`, and dismiss avail via `studio-post-agent-reset` on no-reload stop.
- **Overlay ≠ lightbox** — opaque full-screen “AGENT TESTING” modals rage the PO and hide the page under test; keep the concept visible.
